## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare hardware
Compatible with [XiaoZhi](https://github.com/78/xiaozhi-esp32) hardware, but only the microphone(INMP441) and speaker(MAX98357A) are needed in this version. Only the ESP32S3-N16R8 chip is supported now.
### 2. Download and flash firmware
Download the latest firmware from the [release page](https://github.com/LSimon95/XiaoGuaRTC/releases). If you want to compile the firmware yourself, please refer to the [compile guide](#compile-guide). Use the [esptool](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-test-tools/zh_CN/latest/esp32/production_stage/tools/flash_download_tool.html) to flash the firmware to the ESP32S3 chip. 
### 3. Connect to internet and register
After the firmware is flashed, the device will create a hotspot named `XiaoGuaRTC-XXXX`. Connect to the hotspot and open the browser to visit `http://192.168.4.1`. Follow the instructions to connect to the internet.
Register an account on the [ZideAI](https://www.zideai.com) website and create a new device. Input the 6-digit device code(Audio code) to the website and bind the device.
### 4. Enjoy
After the device is connected to the internet, the device will automatically connect to the AI server. Say the default wake word `‰Ω†Â•ΩÂ∞èÁìú` to wake up the AI and start chatting.
